Run the wallet.
Go to start, type %appdata%\printerium and press the enter key. You will then be in a folder with the Printerium app-data. 
Back-up your WALLET.DAT file (You may copy the file to another safe location). DO NOT DELETE the WALLET.DAT file
Remove all other files from the Printerium app-data folder except the WALLET.DAT file. Place the bootstrap.dat file and printerium.conf files  
Restart your wallet, wait for the bootstrap to import the blockchain.
